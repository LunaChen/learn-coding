My journey of learning coding

Good designers collaborate with engineers well. 
A best way to improve communication is to learn each other's languages. 
That's why I think it's important for designers to learn coding. 

Designers have the power to create dreams. But that's just half of the story. Engineers have the power to realize the dreams.
I'd like to arm myself with both powers to make impact and make the world a better place :)
