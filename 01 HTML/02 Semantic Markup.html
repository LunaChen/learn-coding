<!-- 
	There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of the web pages, but they do add extra info to the pages.
	They are known as Semantic Markup!

	Browsers often displaythe contents of these elements in a different way. But you should NOT use them to change the way the text looks; their purpose is to describe the content of the web page more accurately.
